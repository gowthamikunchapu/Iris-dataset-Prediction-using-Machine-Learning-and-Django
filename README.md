# Iris-dataset-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-and-Django
This project builds a web-based application to predict the species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using machine learning. Users enter sepal and petal dimensions, and the system provides real-time predictions via a Django-powered interface.
