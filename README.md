# Iris-dataset-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-and-Django
Overview
This project builds a web-based application to predict the species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using machine learning. Users enter sepal and petal dimensions, and the system provides real-time predictions via a Django-powered interface.

Technologies Used
Machine Learning:KNN
Dataset: Iris dataset
Web Framework: Django
Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
Workflow
Train a model with the Iris dataset.
Integrate the model into Django for real-time predictions.
Users input flower measurements via a form, and the predicted species is displayed along with an image.
